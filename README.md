## Comaptibility 
Due to rapidly changing react native eco system, some version mismatch errors could occur while building the application.
This application is using react native version 0.52 right now. 


## Project Wide Properties
Project wide properties can be defined inside android/build.gradle in case of version mismatch errors. For example. 

```
ext {
    compileSdkVersion = 26
    targetSdkVersion = 22   
    buildToolsVersion = "26.0.2"
    //supportLibVersion = "27.1.0"
    googlePlayServicesVersion = "11.2.0"
    gradle3EXPERIMENTAL = "yes"
}
```
now default versions are superseded by these versions defined in build.gradle file.
